    # Shared migration-copy logic for the install and upgrade generators.
    #
    # Copying is idempotent: a migration whose name already exists in the host
    # application's db/migrate is skipped, so it is safe to re-run either
    # generator. `install` copies the full set (a fresh app has none yet);
    # `upgrade` copies only the migrations a previously-installed app is missing.
    # Both share this method — the difference is purely which migrations already
    # exist in the target app.
    #
    # MIGRATIONS is listed in application order; copying preserves that order
    # because each migration_template assigns the next sequential version number.
