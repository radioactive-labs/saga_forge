module SagaForge
  # A single, unified description of retry behavior shared by every retry site
  # (step failures and compensation failures).
  #
  # It answers the only two questions a retry site ever asks:
  #   - retryable?(error, attempts) — should this failure be retried?
  #   - backoff_for(attempts)       — how long until the next attempt?
  #
  # `attempts` is always the 1-based count of attempts made so far, *including*
  # the one that just failed (matching Event#attempts). So on the first
  # failure `attempts == 1`.

    # @param max_attempts [Integer, nil] cap on total attempts; nil = no count
    #   cap (bounded elsewhere by the caller)
    # @param base [Numeric, ActiveSupport::Duration] delay of the first retry
    # @param cap [Numeric, ActiveSupport::Duration] ceiling for a single delay
    # @param jitter [Boolean] apply equal jitter to spread retries
    # @param retry_on [Array<Class>, nil] nil = retry any StandardError;
    #   an array = retry only those classes (and subclasses); [] = retry nothing

    # half. Computed once at re-enqueue time and never persisted, so the

    # keys the policy's attempt budget (see Event#retry_budgets), so the
    # budget is shared across every class the policy lists (and their
    # subclasses) and is independent of the policy's position — reordering
    # the composite does not reset counts. A catch-all (retry_on: nil) keys

    # rollback leaves the saga in a half-undone state, which is worse than
    # retrying for a long time. So compensations get a far more tolerant
    # policy than steps. 10 attempts gives a tolerant window of up to ~8.5
    # min (≈4 min typical, since equal jitter puts each wait in [d/2, d]) —
    # enough for a DB failover or deploy restart — without retrying forever
    # on a deterministic bug; cap (600s / 10 min) bounds any single backoff
    # and only binds if a caller configures more attempts.
