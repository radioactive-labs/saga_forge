  # An ordered list of RetryPolicy objects, each scoped to an error type via
  # its `retry_on`. On failure the first policy whose `retry_on` matches the
  # raised error (by `is_a?`) is applied, giving each error type its own
  # independent attempt budget and backoff curve. Put specific policies first
  # and a catch-all (`retry_on: nil`) last; an unmatched error is not retried.
  #
  # Pure: it never reads storage. The per-error count is supplied by the
  # caller through the block passed to #retry_backoff, keyed by the matched
  # policy's budget_key (its declared errors) — the caller is expected to
  # persist counts per budget_key, e.g. in Event#retry_budgets.
